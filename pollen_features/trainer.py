trainer.py (archived stub)

The original deep-learning trainer has been removed from the main project
and archived. If you need to restore it, find an archived copy in
`archive/trainer_deprecated.py` or retrieve the previous git history.

This stub keeps the import path available but raises at runtime to avoid
accidental use in environments without PyTorch.
